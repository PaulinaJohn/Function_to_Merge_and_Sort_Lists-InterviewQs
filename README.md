[InterviewQs](https://www.interviewqs.com/), one of my email newsletter buddies, never misses sending me Data Science and Analytics interview questions (Specifically, SQL and Python) 3 days a week.

On this occasion, I was tasked to create a function to be used in merging and sorting arrays using Python.

Find my attempt in the accompanying notebook.

Thank you.
