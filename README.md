[InterviewQs](https://www.interviewqs.com/), one of my email newsletter buddies, never misses sending me Data Science and Analytics interview questions (specifically, SQL and Python) 3 times a week.

On this occasion, I was tasked to create a function to be used in merging and sorting arrays using Python.

Find below, a screenshot of the question, and my attempt in the accompanying notebook.

Thank you.
